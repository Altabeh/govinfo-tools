# govinfo-tools

This API provides a search-and-download crawler for any legal document available under advanced search feature of
www.govinfo.gov. The most important advantage of this crawler is that it is indeed a backdoor method to get data
and therefore is not restricted by govinfo's API limitations. For example, API calls to govinfo's server has to
be limited to 1000 per hour whereas you can make as many as 10000 calls per minute using this crawler.
