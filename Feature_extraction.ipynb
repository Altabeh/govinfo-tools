      "['Appeal pending. $$ The plaintiff has appealed from the defendant\\'s Order No. I 79-40, dated July 13, 1979. $$ The facts have been stipulated. The plaintiff is a federal savings and loan association, chartered under the Homeowners\\' Loan Act of 1933 (12 U.S.C. § 1461 et seq.), administered by the Homeowners\\' Loan Corporation. Plaintiff has its principal office in Tacoma, Washington, but also maintains four branch offices within the State of Oregon, located in Portland, Eugene, Springfield and Bend. Each branch is independent of the others, each reporting directly to the principal office. $$ For income tax years before, during and after the income tax year 1974, plaintiff was subject to the Corporation Income Tax Act of 1955 (ORS Chapter 318). A tax is imposed by that act upon the corporate \"net income derived from sources within this state, other than income for which the corporation is subject to the tax imposed by the Corporation Excise Tax Law of 1929 (ORS Chapter 317) according to or measured by its net income\". As in the case of other interstate financial corporations, the income ascribable to Oregon is determined under the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act, ORS 314.605 et seq. $$ The plaintiff is an \"insured depository\" within the provisions of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation Act (12 U.S.C. §§ 1724-1730). $$ On August 16, 1973, effective 30 days thereafter, Congress approved Public Law 93-100. Section 7 thereof is pertinent to this suit. It reads as follows: $$     \"Sec. 7(a). This section may be cited as the \\'State Taxation of Depositories Act\\'. $$     \"(b) The Congress finds that the national goals of fostering an efficient banking system and the free flow of commerce among the States will be furthered by clarifying the principles governing State taxation of interstate transactions of banks and other depositories. Application of taxes measured by income or receipts, or other \\'doing business\\' taxes in States other than the *Page 468 States in which depositories have their principal offices should be deferred until such time as uniform and equitable methods are developed for determining jurisdiction to tax and for dividing the tar base among States. (Emphasis supplied.) $$     \"(c) With respect to any taxable year or other taxable period beginning on or after the date of enactment of this section [August 16, 1973] and before January 1, 1976, no State or political subdivision thereof may impose any tax measured by income or receipts or any other \\'doing business\\' tax on any insured depository not having its principal office within such State\". $$ In its income tax return for 1974, plaintiff had stated: \"In accordance with Public Law 93-100, the company has no taxable income in the State of Oregon\". Without setting out its legal reasoning, the defendant department\\'s opinion concluded that the federal government exceeded its constitutional authority in enacting Public Law 93-100 and found it to be unconstitutional. The defendant department\\'s order held that the plaintiff was liable for income taxes for that year in the sum of $242,394, plus interest. $$ The facts having been stipulated, the suit was submitted on briefs and exhibits and oral argument. The sole issue presented is: Does Congress have the constitutional authority to enact a statute which imposes a temporary moratorium on state income taxation of a federal savings and loan association (an \"insured depository\") which does not have its principal office within the taxing state? $$ Exhibits attached to the Plaintiff\\'s Reply Brief (filed in this court on November 23, 1979), as to which the court takes judicial notice, give some insight into the reasons for passage by the U.S. Congress of Public Law 93-100, section 7(b). Taken in chronological order, the first is a report to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, United States Senate, entitled \"State and Local Taxation of Banks,\" a report prepared by the Board of Governors of the Federal *Page 469  $$ Reserve System, published in May 1971 (see App B, Pl Rep Br). A recommendation made by the Federal Reserve (page 4 of its report), relating to taxation by states other than the state of the principal office, seeks to limit the circumstances in which national banks and other depository institutions may be subject to state or local government taxes on or measured by net income, and to prescribe rules for such taxation. Apparently, one of the fears of the Federal Reserve Board was that the home state might be required to divide the tax base of its domiciliary banks with other states or, on the other hand, it might acquire jurisdiction over part of the tax base of nondomiciliary banks. As stated in the report: $$     \"With interstate division of the tax base, assurances are needed that the sum of the taxable base on which two or more States levy taxes will not exceed 100 percent of the actual base. But even where this limit is not exceeded, serious burdens may result when two or more States claiming jurisdiction to tax, for example, the same net income, use different rules for interstate division of the tax base and require different kinds of records and reports. $$     \"If interstate division of the taxable net income of banks were to conform closely to procedures currently applied to other businesses by most States, there would be — with present lending practices — comparatively little allocation or apportionment of the tax base to States other than the home State of the banks. However, if all restrictions on taxing out-of-State institutions were removed, States could be expected to modify their allocation procedures so as to apply their levies to an increasing proportion of the tax base of out-of-State banks. This could involve the introduction of new division-of-base measures tailored particularly to financial intermediaries\". $$ The next item which explains the enactment of Public Law 93-100 is Senate Report (Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee) No. 93-149, May 14, 1973 (App A, P1 Rep Br). It states (on page 2020): $$     \"Taxation of the transactions of out-of-State depositories *Page 470  $$ raises a number of difficult legal questions as well as operating and administrative problems. $$     \"If an individual State decides to impose a \\'doing business\\' tax and other neighboring States do not, this will tend to cause lendable funds to dry up in the taxing State. There is also the danger in multi-State tax situations of a tax base exceeding 100%. But even where this limit is not exceeded, serious problems may result when two or more States claiming jurisdiction to tax use different rules and require different kinds of reports and records. $$     \"The Committee believes that the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations is eminently qualified to assume this task [of study and preparation of recommendations to Congress] since the Commission members include Federal Executive and Legislative Branch representatives, State legislators and State and local executives\". $$ The report quotes a letter from Rep. Ralph Turlington, Chairman, Government Operations Task Force, dated April 16, 1973, which includes the following: $$     \"One further objective of the bill is to render an exemption to these institutions [federally insured depositories] from the payment of either a state income or franchise tax in a State, other than the State where its principal office is located, even though these same institutions are doing business, or earning income, in those States. While we oppose such favored treatment, we do feel that some ground rules dealing with apportionment of taxable financial institutions income between States is certainly worthy of development. In this regard, the Government Operations Task Force of the National Legislative Conference feels that a brief moratorium on the interstate taxation of federally insured depositories is in order, during which time a fair and equitable apportionment formula can be agreed upon. Because of the representation of the States on the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, we feel that ACIR would be the proper institution to develop recommendations concerning equitable state taxation of out-of-state commercial banks, mutual savings banks, and savings and loan associations and other matters relating to the question of multi-states taxation. * * *\" (Emphasis supplied.) *Page 471 $$ A study and report was made by the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, United States Senate, in May 1975 (supplemented September 1975), entitled \"State and Local \\'Doing Business\\' Taxes on Out-of-State Financial Depositories, Report of a Study in Public Law 93-100\". Respecting Public Law 93-100, sec. 7, the ACIR stated at page 485 (App C, Pl Rep Br): $$     \"One of the most preemptive of approaches to the question of Federal intervention would be congressional action prohibiting taxation of depositories by any State other than the State of corporate domicile. * * *\" $$ The next pages of the report refer to many complicating factors which must be considered if the moratorium were made permanent and then concludes (at 487): $$     \"* * * But it would require a degree of congressional intervention in State policies and fiscal claims which many States could be expected to oppose\". $$ The ACIR gave no thought as to the congressional power to establish a moratorium but, after its report was received, the Congress did nothing more and allowed Public Law 93-100 to expire, pursuant to its own time limitation. $$ [2.] The several briefs presented to the court by counsel are evidence of assiduous study of the question presented, but no judicial decisions have been offered which are squarely in point with the issue; i.e., the constitutionality of the use of a moratorium within the facts of this suit. There is no question but that the Homeowners\\' Loan Corporation is a federal instrumentality1 and that the federal savings and loan association is a \"creature\" of that corporation. The preponderance of the authority would indicate that it, too, is a \"federal *Page 472  $$ instrumentality\". (See P1 Supp Memo, filed 2-25-80, and cases cited therein.) However, the United States Supreme Court has made clear that the several states can impose taxes upon a federal instrumentality as long as they act in a nondiscriminatory fashion. First Federal Savings  Loan v.Mass. Tax Comm\\'n, 437 U.S. 255, 98 S Ct 2333, 57 L Ed2d 187 $$ (1978). Plaintiff agrees that the tax applied by ORS chapter 318 is nondiscriminatory.2 $$ The recommendations to the Congress made by the Federal Reserve Board, and the reports of the congressional committees cited and quoted above, indicate that, at the time of their publication, an apparently bona fide question had been raised as to the possibility of discrimination by the states in the taxation of branches of federal savings and loan associations in a given state (the principal office of such \"insured depository\" being located in another state). Nothing has been brought to the court\\'s attention that would suggest that this question was without foundation and was arbitrarily seized upon by the Congress to wrest taxing power from a sovereign state. $$ The question having been raised in the Congress, study thereof was required. Study takes time. The Congress could have allowed the continuation of the status quo while necessary study was being made. If it reasonably appeared, ab initio, $$ that there was significant danger that improper impositions could be made by some state or states, affecting the flow of loan money from federal banking establishments, the Congress *Page 473  $$ could certainly follow its own judgment in determining that a relatively brief moratorium should be utilized, pending conclusion of studies. Nothing has been shown in this suit that Congress acted unfairly. $$ The authority of Congress to enact a moratorium under the facts set out above, relating to a class of federal banking institutions, denominated for convenience as \"insured depositories,\" in order to develop a uniform and equitable taxing system, although temporarily detrimental to the revenues of a particular state, seems clearly to come within the provisions of the U.S. Const., art VI, cl 2: $$     \"This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof * * * shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding\". $$ The Supremacy Clause appears to this date to contain more power than the Tenth Amendment. M\\'Culloch v. Maryland, 17 US (4 Wheat) 316, 4 L Ed 579 (1819), has not yet weathered away. John Marshall, C.J., stated therein: $$     \"This government is acknowledged by all to be one of enumerated powers. The principle, that it can exercise only the powers granted to it, would seem too apparent to have required to be enforced by all those arguments which its enlightened friends, while it was depending before the people, found it necessary to urge. That principle is now universally admitted. But the question respecting the extent of the powers actually granted, is perpetually arising, and will probably continue to arise, as long as our system shall exist. $$     \"In discussing these questions, the conflicting powers of the general and state governments must be brought into view, and the supremacy of their respective laws, when they are in opposition, must be settled. $$     \"If any one proposition could command the universal assent of mankind, we might expect it would be this — that the government of the Union, though limited in its powers, is supreme within its sphere of action. * * *\" (17 US (4 Wheat) 316, 405,  4 L Ed 579, 601 (1819).) *Page 474 $$ M\\'Culloch v. Maryland specifically established the power of the federal government to create such system of banks as might be found necessary for the administration of federal powers stated in the U.S. Constitution, although \"banking\" is not specifically referred to in that document. $$ Conflicting state law and policy must yield to the federal statute and policy. Although constant attacks have been made by the states (and must ever continue) in order to determine the extent or limitations of federal power, a nationally known commentator, Edward S. Corwin, has concluded: $$     \"But Congress is still able, by virtue of the necessary and proper and supremacy clauses in conjunction, to exempt instrumentalities of the National Government, or private gains therefrom, from State or local taxation; but any person, natural or corporate, claiming such an exemption must ordinarily be able to point to an explicit stipulation by Congress to that effect. Moreover, Congress is always free to waive such exemptions when it can do so without breach of contract, and any such waiver will generally be liberally construed by the Court in favor of the taxing authority\". (Corwin, The Constitution and What It Means Today 227 (1973 ed).) $$ The Tenth Amendment, although subordinate to the Supremacy Clause, still has its uses, as is illustrated by NationalLeague of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833, 96 S Ct 2465,49 L Ed2d 245 (1976), but the issue involved in that case is in sharp contrast to the situation which confronts the court in the present suit.3 It must constantly be held in mind that the issue before this court deals only with the congressional power to provide by statute a brief moratorium which *Page 475  $$ affects a very limited number of federal savings and loan associations,4 one of which is doing business in Oregon. The federal act does not seek to impose immediately upon the state some discriminatory tax which favors the federal tax system in comparison to the state\\'s system. The act merely provides time to make inquiry into questions relating to the possibility of discrimination by states in the taxing of a federal instrumentality. So far as the record in this proceeding shows, the questions were relevant and bona fide.5 $$ The court recognizes that a federal measure creating a moratorium is the exercise of a power which can easily be abused.6 However, it is the duty of Congress to set policy and to enact statutes in support thereof. A moratorium, by its very nature, is in derogation of these requirements. A moratorium is a \"freezing\"; an inaction or a nonaction. But it has its uses and justification. Its use can be analogous to the \"stay\" of collection of taxes which can be issued in the discretion of the judge of this tax court, when a substantial public interest requires, pursuant to ORS 305.565. The moratorium was so used in Public Law 93-100, sec. 7(c). $$ The defendant erred in its determination that the federal Public Law 93-100, sec. 7, was unconstitutional. Its action was premature. Defendant\\'s Order *Page 476  $$ I 79-40 must be set aside and held for naught. Plaintiff is not required to pay corporation income taxes to Oregon for the tax year 1974. Plaintiff is entitled to its statutory costs and disbursements. $$ 1 Laurens F.S.  L. v. South Carolina Tax Comm., 365 U.S. 517,81 S Ct 719, 5 L Ed2d 749 (1961); Pittman v. Home Owners\\' LoanCorp. of Wash., D.C., 308 U.S. 21, 60 S Ct 15, 84 L Ed 11 (1939). $$ 2 This court recognizes that federal savings and loan associations are privately owned corporations seeking private profit. They perform few, if any, functions which differ from the usual, regular performance and procedures of a state savings and loan association. The court is impressed by Justice Thurgood Marshall\\'s dissent in Agric. Nat. Bank v. TaxCommission, 392 U.S. 339, 88 S Ct 2173, 20 L Ed2d 1138 (1968), in which he wrote that the fact that institutions owe their existence to (are chartered by) the federal government must be rejected as a basis for tax immunity at the state and local level. The real issue, he observed, is that any tax imposed must be nondiscriminatory in its effect on all persons within the properly prescribed classification which is subjected to the tax. $$ 3 In Usery, the U.S. Supreme Court found the federal Fair Labor Standards Act had been amended in 1974 to require all states and their political subdivisions to apply the Act\\'s minimum wage and maximum hour provisions to almost all state and local government employees. This amendment was deemed to exceed the powers of Congress and was stricken. (The case is useful in illustrating the continuing problem of interpretation to which Chief Justice John Marshall alluded, as quoted on page 473 of this opinion. In contrast, see the recent decision in ArizonaPublic Service Co. v. Snead, 441 U.S. 141, 99 S Ct 1629, 60 L Ed2d 106 (1979).) $$ 4 See P1 Rep Br 10, quoting the ACIR report. $$ 5 The court does not overlook the revenue lost to the state during the moratorium ($242,394 in 1974). In Congress, such a sum is probably deemed insignificant. Even in Oregon, where parsimony in government is the rule, that sum represents only 0.0024 percent of the revenue received by the state under ORS chapter 318 in 1974 ($102, 338, 535). (Source: Dept. of Rev. Monthly Receipts and Distribution Reports to the Legislative Revenue Office.) $$ 6 See the history of federal Public Law 86-272 (72 Stat 555), limiting the states\\' nondiscriminatory income taxation of interstate corporations. This measure, enacted as a temporary statute on September 14, 1959, still continues in effect, pending further congressional action. $$ Consider also the tax and record-keeping problems engendered by two congressional postponements of \"carry-over\" bases under the federal inheritance tax laws for most property acquired from a decedent. IRC (1954), §§ 1016(c), 1040 and 2614(a). PL 96-223, § 401(a) (4-2-80); PL 94-455 (10-4-78). $$  *Page 1 ']\n"

See the parties\\' joint tutorial of the tech- nology presented to the ALJ, Hr\\'g Tr. Apr. 29, 2009 $$ The electric current generated by wind turbines is usu- ally fed to a centralized power grid, where electricity from various facilities is combined, stored, and distributed. Although wind is an advantageous source of energy, wind activity tends to be extremely irregular, whereas uniform electric current of fixed frequency is required to be fed to the power grid. This led to the development of variable speed wind turbines, which convert the irregular product of wind energy into the fixed-frequency alternating current (AC) required by the power grid.

ITC larities caused by emergency events such as lightning strikes, downed power lines, short circuits, and the like $$ The products whose importation is charged with viola- tion of section 337 are variable speed wind turbines desig- nated as Mitsubishi models MWT 92 and MWT 95. As products of the domestic industry, General Electric desig- nated its models SLE, XLE, and SE. The Mitsubishi and General Electric turbines have the structure and circuit configuration called a \"doubly-fed induction generator,\" illustrated as follows: Gen. Elec. Br. 17 (from J.A. 2222). In operation, the wind turns the blades and causes the shaft to rotate, thereby spinning the rotor and producing a magnetic field in the winding coils, generating electric current. To produce AC electricity of uniform and fixed frequency, in doubly-fed induction generators a second magnetic field is imposed by current drawn from the grid and, by operations not here at issue, the system produces electricity of the desired uniform frequency. Testimony of Dr. Collins, Hr\\'g Tr. 46-48 (Apr. 29, 2009), J.A. 2746-48. GENERAL ELECTRIC v. ITC 6 I THE \\'221 PATENT The \\'221 patent relates to protective circuitry for varia- tions in grid supply voltage in doubly fed induction genera- tor wind turbines. The patent explains that the problem arises that large voltage differences be- tween grid and stator coils occur on variations of the supply voltage amplitudes caused in the grid by, e.g., short circuits. These differences cause, in turn, a strong current rise in the stator coils directly cou- pled to the grid. These strong current rises in the stator coils are caused because the induction gen- erator is usually fully excited at the variation of the grid frequency amplitude and mechanical energy is permanently supplied by the rotor. The strong cur- rent rise occurring in the stator coils on variations of the supply voltage leads to high induction volt- ages in the rotor windings, which can, in turn, cause damages on the converters used for feeding the ro- tor current. \\'221 patent, col.1 ll.45-57. The \\'221 patent employs a protec- tive circuit called a \"crowbar circuit,\" which decouples the current feed-in unit from the rotor windings when large current variations occur, thereby protecting the circuitry. Both the imported Mitsubishi and the domestic General Electric wind turbines employ a system of protective de- coupling of the rotor windings from the feed-in converter, but the turbines differ in the method by which operation is restored. In the General Electric turbines recoupling of the circuitry occurs when the emergency-induced elevation in current has declined to a predetermined value as measured 7 GENERAL ELECTRIC v. ITC in the turbine, and in the Mitsubishi turbines recoupling occurs after a pre-set period of time $$ A. Claim Construction The issue of infringement of the \\'221 patent was deter- mined based on the Commission\\'s construction of the \\'221 claims with respect to the method of restoring operation after an emergency-induced decoupling. The claim con- struction question is the meaning of the term \"predeter- mined value\" in the \\'221 patent claim 5 (emphases added): 5. A wind turbine, comprising: a rotor with at least one rotor blade, the rotor being rotatably arranged with regard to a substan- tially horizontal rotor axis; an induction generator whose rotor windings are coupled to the rotor and whose stator coils can be coupled to a voltage grid; a feed-in unit for feeding currents into the rotor windings; a control unit for controlling the frequency of the fed-in currents depending on the rotor rotation frequency, and an emergency unit which can be operated to electrically decouple the feed-in unit from the rotor windings in case of variations of the grid voltage amplitude, wherein the emergency unit comprises a release arrangement for releasing the rotor current feed-in after decoupling, when the currents gener- ated in the rotor windings by variation of the grid voltage amplitude triggering the decoupling are de- clined to a predetermined value. The Commission held that the claim\\'s release arrangement \"requires the wind turbine to measure current or an ade- GENERAL ELECTRIC v. ITC 8 quate proxy for current to determine whether the current has declined to a level previously decided upon\". Final Determination, at 26. The Commission held that a pre-set period of time is not such a proxy for current $$ General Electric argues that the term \"predetermined value,\" construed in light of the specification, includes not only a value of current, but also a predetermined period of time, for the \\'221 patent states that turbine operation can be resumed \"under consideration of a predetermined time constant\". \\'221 patent, col.3 ll.5-6. General Electric points out that the \\'221 patent recognizes and recites time periods for externally-caused fluctuations in current, and argues that the Commission incorrectly construed the claims as excluding a predetermined time constant from \"predeter- mined value\". General Electric cites several supporting statements in the \\'221 specification: Basically, resuming the feeding of rotor current can be accomplished under consideration of a prede- termined time constant. In view of an increase in plant safety, it has been shown particularly expedi- ent that when the rotor current is sensed as a two or three-phase signal or the rectified current is sensed as a single-phase signal and the current that was sensed drops to a pre-determined value, the feeding of the rotor current is resumed. Current transformers (e.g. current-compensated transform- ers) can be used for sensing the currents. three_dots When the amplitude of the rotor current has dropped sufficiently after 100 to 200 msec [mil- liseconds], the feeding of the rotor current can be resumed on recurrence of the supply voltage within the framework of the method according to the in- vention. 9 GENERAL ELECTRIC v. ITC three_dots As is explained above, in this case the rotor and the starter current diminish within 50 to 150 msec depending on the resistance. Id. at col.3 ll.4-13, col.3 ll.37-40, col.3 ll.54-56. General Electric, citing Honeywell International, Inc. v. ITT Indus- tries, Inc., 452 F.3d 1312, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2006), argues that because the specification refers to a predetermined time constant \"within the framework of the method according to the invention,\" the passage of a fixed period of time is in- cluded in the scope of the claims. The ALJ agreed with General Electric\\'s position, and held that \"[a] time constant, in the form of a specific time range, may be considered when determining that predetermined value\". Initial Determina- tion, at 70 $$ The full Commission did not agree with the ALJ. The Commission found that the portion of the specification that mentions a \"predetermined time constant\" is in the context of an \"increase in plant safety,\" col.3 l.6, and that the speci- fication teaches that measurement of current, not time, increases safety. The Commission found that the specifica- tion \"presents the latter current-drop mode as an improve- ment on the former amount-of-time mode\". Final Determination, at 27. The \\'221 specification\\'s only descrip- tion of the operation of the invention shows recoupling upon measurement of a predetermined value of current, not upon passage of a pre-set period of time $$ We share the Commission\\'s view that the patentee de- scribes the invention as the resumption of current feed after the current is restored to the predetermined value, not after a fixed period of time. The specification describes and enables the deactivation of the crowbar circuit \"[w]hen the current drops afterwards to a predetermined value\" of current; there is no description or exemplification of re- GENERAL ELECTRIC v. ITC 10 sumption of operation by recoupling the rotor currents after a pre-set period of time. The specification states: As is shown in FIG. 3, short-circuit element 60 (\\'crow bar\\') can be realized as a B6 bridge. In this case, the dying out of the rectified rotor currents can be accomplished via a current transformer resistor 62 in the B6 bridge. When the intermediate circuit voltage in converter 50 exceeds a predetermined value due to exceedingly high rotor currents, the crow bar formed as a B6 bridge is fired. Then, the same procedure as in the case of a short-circuit of the grid is executed. Should an exceedingly high current appear in the rotor due to a short-term un- dervoltage of the grid, the turbine really acts like in the case of a short-circuit of the grid. When the cur- rent drops afterwards to a predetermined value, the thyristors of the B6 bridge become blocked and the short-circuiting of the rotor windings 34 is ended. The feed-in of rotor currents is then resumed. Con- sequently, the thyristors form the release arrange- ment of the embodiment of the present invention. \\'221 patent, col.5 ll.8-24 (emphases added). Figure 3, to which this passage refers, shows the crowbar circuit 60 formed as a bridge that short-circuits and thereby decouples the rotor windings 34 upon the occurrence of exceedingly high rotor current. Figure 3, a detailed view of the circuit diagram in patent Figure 1, shows the transformer resistor 62, the rotor-sided rotor converter 54, and stator coils 32: 11 GENERAL ELECTRIC v. ITC The specification explains that the crowbar circuit 60 is deactivated, the bridge is blocked, and the rotor windings are recoupled, when the current drops to the predetermined value $$ No embodiment in the patent, no drawing, no circuitry, shows recoupling solely after a predetermined period of time. Although the specification shows that General Elec- tric knew that various electrical disturbances for which this protective circuitry is intended occur within a known dura- tion, the \\'221 invention as claimed is explicitly limited to recoupling when the actual end of the specific disturbance has been determined by measurement of when the current has declined to a predetermined value. Although General Electric recognized and described the usual duration of such electrical disturbances, a possibly broader disclosure accom- panied by an explicit narrow claim shows the inventor\\'s selection of the narrow claim scope. See 35 U.S.C. §112 ¶2 (\"The specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention\".). GENERAL ELECTRIC v. ITC 12 The Commission held that the \\'221 claims are directed to a predetermined value of current or a proxy for current. The inclusion of a proxy for current comports with Linear Technology Corp. v. International Trade Commission, 566 F.3d 1049, 1060 (Fed. Cir. 2009), which held that \"monitor- ing the current to the load\" could be indirectly measured by voltage, for \"once voltage is known, one skilled in the art would recognize that Ohm\\'s Law4 easily allows current to be calculated, therefore monitoring current indirectly by moni- toring voltage\". The Commission\\'s construction of \"prede- termined value\" as a value of current or a proxy for current \"stays true to the claim language and most naturally aligns with the patent\\'s description of the invention\". Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc) (quoting Renishaw PLC v. Marposs Societa per Azioni, 158 F.3d 1243, 1250 (Fed. Cir. 1998)). This claim construction is affirmed $$ B. Infringement For infringement, every element and limitation of a claim of the patent must be found in the accused device, literally or in accordance with the doctrine of equivalents. It is not disputed that the Mitsubishi turbines do not meas- ure current or voltage in determining when to resume the feed-in connection after decoupling has occurred. The record contains expert testimony on the question of whether a pre-set time period in the Mitsubishi turbines is an ade- quate proxy for current. The experts for both sides agreed 4 Ohm\\'s Law is a principle of electrical circuits and is represented by the equation I (current) = V (voltage) / R (resistance). Thus, it states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points, and inversely proportional to the resistance between them\". Linear Tech., 566 F.3d at 1059 n.4. 13 GENERAL ELECTRIC v. ITC that there is no predictable relationship between the dura- tion of low-voltage events and the restoration of safe current levels, because of the variety of factors that can affect such events and their duration. Testimony of Dr. Toliyat, Hr\\'g Tr. 1453:10-19 (May 15, 2009), J.A. 4168; Testimony of Dr. Collins, Hr\\'g Tr. 978:12-22 (May 13, 2009), J.A. 3645. The experts\\' testimony supports the Commission\\'s finding that a predetermined value of time \"cannot serve as an adequate proxy for current because the relationship between the two cannot be guaranteed\". Final Determination, at 27. We affirm the Commission\\'s finding that the Mitsubishi tur- bine, whereby recoupling occurs after a pre-set period of time, does not literally infringe the \\'221 claims $$ General Electric argued that even if there is not literal infringement, the doctrine of equivalents applies because the system in the \\'221 patent and the Mitsubishi system perform substantially the same function in substantially the same way to achieve the same result, whether recoupling is measured by current drop or by the passage of time. See Voda v. Cordis Corp., 536 F.3d 1311, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (summarizing the criteria of infringement based on equiva- lency). The Commission found that a system that measures when the specific emergency event has actually ended is not substantially the same as a system that applies the same time period to all emergency events. This finding was supported by substantial evidence in the form of the experts\\' testimony with respect to the technological facts. The Commission\\'s determination that the Mitsubishi turbines do not infringe the \\'221 patent under the doctrine of equiva- lents is affirmed $$ C. Domestic Industry In view of our affirmance of noninfringement of the \\'221 patent, we affirm that section 337 is not violated based on GENERAL ELECTRIC v. ITC 14 the \\'221 patent. Although the Commission also ruled that General Electric\\'s turbines do not now practice the \\'221 invention and therefore do not meet the domestic industry requirement as to this patent, we do not reach that aspect, and vacate the Commission\\'s ruling thereon $$ II THE \\'985 PATENT The \\'985 patent is directed to wind turbine circuitry that provides a stable output of electricity to the grid during low voltage events. The Commission construed the \\'985 patent claim 15, the only claim at issue, in a manner that excluded the General Electric turbines from the scope of the claim, and on this claim construction the Commission held that there is no domestic industry as to the \\'985 patent. The domestic industry requirement of the Tariff Act is set forth in 19 U.S.C. §1337(a), subsections (2) and (3): §1337(a)(2) Subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), and (E) of paragraph (1) [concerning violations of section 337] apply only if an industry in the United States, relat- ing to the articles protected by the patent, copy- right, trademark, mask work, or design concerned, exists or is in the process of being established $$ (a)(3) For purposes of paragraph (2), an industry in the United States shall be considered to exist if there is in the United States, with respect to the ar- ticles protected by the patent, copyright, trademark, mask work or design concerned— (A) significant investment in plant and equipment; 15 GENERAL ELECTRIC v. ITC (B) significant employment of labor or capital; or (C) substantial investment in its exploi- tation, including engineering, research and development, or licensing $$ The \\'985 patent, entitled \"Low Voltage Ride Through for Wind Turbine Generators,\" is directed to wind turbine structure and circuitry that provide \"ride through\" stabiliza- tion in periods of voltage fluctuation. The \\'985 specification describes low voltage ride through as providing one or more of the following responses to voltage fluctuation: 1) to remain synchronized to the power grid during severe voltage fluctuations, 2) to maintain function- ing of the blade pitch system in spite of lack of volt- age at the generator terminals, 3) to protect the power converter and generator from high voltages and currents during the voltage fluctuation, and 4) to temporarily shut down non-vital sub-systems that could be damaged by exposure to low voltages or could be tripped by either circuit breaker action or fuse operation. \\'985 patent, col.2 ll.26-34. Ride through in the \\'985 patent is achieved by circuitry that monitors voltage and provides supplemental power from an uninterruptible power supply when the system signals the need for ride through, and thereby protects the power converter and generator during voltage fluctuations while preserving the turbine\\'s connec- tion with the power grid $$ The Commission construed the \\'985 patent claim 15 with attention to the aspect that is disputed in application GENERAL ELECTRIC v. ITC 16 to the General Electric turbines (emphasis added to the aspect of concern): 15. A wind turbine generator comprising: a generator; a power converter coupled with the generator, the power converter having an inverter coupled to receive power from the generator, a converter con- troller coupled with the inverter to monitor a cur- rent flow in the inverter wherein the converter controller is coupled to receive power from an unin- terruptible power supply during a low voltage event, and a circuit coupled with the input of the inverter and with the converter controller to shunt current from the inverter and generator rotor in response to a control signal from the converter controller. Patent Figure 4 is \"a block diagram of one embodiment of a power converter having functionality to respond to a low voltage event\". Id. at col.4 ll.44-46: 5 5 This drawing as shown in the briefs is from the pat- ent application, for it was agreed that Figure 4 as printed in the \\'985 patent inadvertently omitted the line connecting Crowbar Circuit 440 to the Rotor Side of the Inverters. 17 GENERAL ELECTRIC v. ITC Figure 4 shows back-to-back inverters as part of the power converter; the inverters receive power as needed during a low voltage event \"to keep the wind turbine generator connected to and synchronized with the power grid\". \\'985 patent, col.6 ll.27-29. The specification describes the con- nections and functions of the components, including the following: Inverter 410 is coupled with the generator (not illustrated in FIG. 4) and to inverter 420 which is coupled with the power grid. Crowbar circuit 440 is coupled with the output of the generator rotor. Converter controller 430 is coupled to receive data GENERAL ELECTRIC v. ITC 18 indicating the current flowing in inverter 410 and to control crowbar circuit 440. In one embodiment, converter controller 430 selectively activates and deactivates crowbar circuit 440 to maintain the cur- rent in inverter 410 within an acceptable range. Crowbar circuits are known in the art and any appropriate (e.g., a circuit having sufficient power ratings) crowbar circuit can be used. In general, crowbar circuit 440 operates to shunt current from the generator rotor and inverter 410 and maintain inverter currents within safe levels. Thus, during normal operation crowbar circuit 440 is inactive. During a low voltage event converter controller 430 selectively activates crowbar circuit 440 to maintain current levels in a safe range. Thus, crowbar circuit 440 and converter controller 430 are part of a sys- tem that allows a wind turbine generator to ride through low voltage events and remain synchro- nized to the power grid. Id. at col.4 l.50 to col.5 l.3 $$ The issue of claim construction was whether claim 15 requires that the circuit that shunts current on signal from the converter controller is located entirely outside of the inverter. The Commission held that the shunt circuit must be separate from the inverter, for otherwise the circuit could not shunt current from the inverter, as claim 15 states. On this construction, the Commission ruled that \"[General Electric\\'s] shunt circuit does not shunt current from the inverter because it is within the inverter\". Final Determina- tion, at 41-42. The ALJ had reached a different conclusion, holding that \"whether a particular shunting circuit located within the inverter (as opposed to outside it) meets the claim limitation will depend upon whether it is found to be \\'coupled with the input of the inverter and the converter 19 GENERAL ELECTRIC v. ITC controller,\\' as required by the claim\". Initial Determination, at 98. The ALJ held that the claim does not contain the additional requirement that the shunt circuit is located entirely outside of the inverter $$ The specification, in describing how the circuit shunts current from the generator rotor and the inverter, and describing the connections of the components, does not require that the components are entirely separate. Provid- ing \"a protective circuit that maintains currents within an allowable range,\" col.4 ll.35-36, does not require that the inverter and shunt circuits are entirely separate. Nor do the words of claim 15 \"coupled with the input of the inverter and with the converter controller,\" connote physical separa- tion of the shunt circuit from the inverter $$ The Commission apparently viewed the claim clause \"shunt current from the inverter and generator rotor\" in isolation from its context as \"a circuit coupled with the input of the inverter and with the converter controller\". However, the function of the shunt circuit does not depend on whether the shunt circuit is entirely outside of the inverter, and the \\'985 specification does not require separation of the inverter and the shunt circuit in order for that circuit to be coupled with the input of the inverter and with the converter con- troller; rather, the term \"coupled with\" indicates a connec- tion. See Johnson Worldwide Assocs., Inc. v. Zebco Corp., 175 F.3d 985, 992 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (\"\\'[C]oupled\\' generically describes a connection, and does not require a mechanical or physical coupling\".) $$ A similar argument was rejected in NTP, Inc. v. Re- search in Motion, Ltd., 418 F.3d 1282 (Fed. Cir. 2005), where some of the claims recited a receiver \"connected to\" or \"coupled to\" a processor or that the receiver \"transfers\" information to the processor. The accused infringer in NTP GENERAL ELECTRIC v. ITC 20 had argued that \"connected to,\" \"coupled to,\" and \"transfer from\" each requires the receiver and the processor to be separate, but the court concluded that \"the two components could be connected, joined, or linked together by wires or other electrical conductors and still be located in the same housing or even on the same circuit board\". 418 F.3d at 1310-11. The court also held that the function that informa- tion is transferred between two entities does not require physical separation of the entities. Id. at 1310. NTP does not support the Commission\\'s ruling that the word \"from\" requires physical separation of the shunt circuit and the inverter $$ We conclude that claim 15 requires that the circuit is coupled with the input of the inverter and the converter controller, whereby the current is shunted from the inverter and the rotor; this requirement does not limit the placement of the shunting circuitry to a location entirely external to the inverter. As in Linear Technology, \"there is nothing in the claim language or specification that supports narrowly construing the terms to require a specific structural re- quirement or entirely distinct [circuits]. Rather, the [cir- cuits] must only perform their stated functions\". 566 F.3d at 1055. 6 Mitsubishi also argues that the General Electric tur- bines embody a modification of the circuitry system in the \\'985 patent, and that this modification is separately pat- 6 Mitsubishi submitted a letter in accordance with Fed. R. App. P. 28(j), arguing that General Electric stated a position before the PTO during the ongoing reexamination of the \\'985 patent that contradicts its arguments here. General Electric responds that its argument distinguishing a certain reference does not conflict with its position here. On the information before us, the reexamination arguments do not affect our conclusion. 21 GENERAL ELECTRIC v. ITC ented in General Electric\\'s U.S. Patent No. 7,239,036. Mitsubishi states that if General Electric\\'s turbines practice the subject matter claimed in a separate patent, they cannot practice the invention of the \\'985 patent. That is not cor- rect, for a separately patented invention may indeed be within the scope of the claims of a dominating patent. See Hoechst Celanese Corp. v. BP Chems. Ltd., 78 F.3d 1575, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (\"The fact of separate patentability presents no legal or evidentiary presumption of nonin- fringement three_dots \".); Atlas Powder Co. v. E.I. du Pont De Nemours & Co., 750 F.2d 1569, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (an improvement in a step of a patented method, even if sepa- rately patentable, may not avoid infringement). The scope of the \\'985 patent is determined on its own terms, independ- ent of whether other aspects or modifications of the technol- ogy are separately patented. The domestic industry requirement is not negated if the technology as employed in the domestic industry has been modified from its form when the patent was obtained $$ We conclude that claim 15, correctly construed, covers the domestic industry turbines. The Commission erred in determining that General Electric does not meet the domes- tic industry requirement with respect to the \\'985 patent. That ruling is reversed. See Osram GmbH v. Int\\'l Trade Comm\\'n, 505 F.3d 1351, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (reversing finding of no domestic industry, on corrected claim construc- tion) $$ SUMMARY The ruling that Mitsubishi\\'s turbines do not violate sec- tion 337 because they do not infringe the \\'221 patent is affirmed. The ruling that the domestic industry require- ment is not met as to the \\'221 patent is vacated as moot. The ruling that there is no domestic industry corresponding GENERAL ELECTRIC v. ITC 22 to the \\'985 patent is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings with respect to the \\'985 patent $$ AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED ']\n"

      "['The homicide took place in the public road between Luverne and Brantley, on a Sunday afternoon. According to the testimony of the state\\'s witnesses, no one was present at the difficulty except the defendants and the deceased. Several witnesses testified to having seen the difficulty from a distance, but none were close enough to hear what was said by either party. After the difficulty was over and Briley was dead, as a result of pistol wounds at the hands of one or both of the defendants, the defendants left the scene in a Ford car and drove to Brantley, some miles away. After defendants had offered evidence tending to prove self-defense and that, in the fight between Dock Jones and deceased, deceased had Dock Jones down on the ground at the time the fatal shots were fired, and that in the scuffle Jones got sand and dirt in his hair and had his shirt torn, and that his face and shirt were in the same condition when he reached Brantley, the defendant offered to prove by the witness Rainer that Dock Jones\\' shirt was torn, and that he had sand and dirt in his hair upon his arrival in Brantley. In Little v. State,18 Ala. App. 98, 89 So. 303, this court held, upon cited authority, that: $$   \"The condition of the assaulted party as the result of the assault was one method of showing the nature and extent of the assault and the injury incident therefrom, and these things were of the res gest of the offense charged\". $$ In McCaig\\'s Case, 16 Ala. App. 581, 80 So. 155, it was held admissible that \"the clothing of one of the girls was torn\". The appearance and description of the body of deceased, and the clothing worn by him at the time of the fatal difficulty, are admissible in evidence. Dorsey v. State, 107 Ala. 157, 18 So. 199. We are of the opinion that a description of the person and clothing of the defendant, shortly after the difficulty *Page 249  $$ in which there is evidence tending to sustain a plea of self-defense, and where there is evidence of the unchanged condition of defendant and his clothing, is admissible as tending to prove the character of the assault claimed to have been made. In this case the defendants claimed that Dock Jones was engaged in a difficulty with deceased, and that deceased had Jones down on the ground, and was on him at the time the fatal shots were fired by the other defendant; that immediately after the shots were fired Dock Jones got in a car, drove to Brantley, and that no change had been made as to his person or clothing after the difficulty. There having been no intervening cause, his condition and that of his clothing would be presumed to be the same as it was immediately after the shooting and before the difficulty had ended. The court erred in excluding this evidence, and the fact that the defendant had testified to these facts, without objection, would not render the error harmless. The defendant\\'s testimony was burdened with his interest, while the corroborating testimony sought was that of disinterested parties. $$ The question asked Dr. Morgan, a defendant\\'s witness, on cross-examination, as to whether the bullets could have ranged upward if deceased had been standing, was legitimate on cross-examination in testing the knowledge of an expert witness. $$ State\\'s witnesses Mesdames Butler, McDougald, Capps, and Dan McDougald were at the house of Charlie Simmons at the time of the shooting, and Mrs. Simmons was also in the house or kitchen. The Simmons house was some distance from where the difficulty took place and not connected with it. Any exclamation on the part of Mrs. Simmons at the sound of the shots was not a part of the res gest and inadmissible for any purpose, she not being examined as a witness. $$ The fact that two or three hours before the difficulty deceased was in the car with defendants, and had in his possession a bottle of whisky, was properly excluded as being irrelevant. $$ The state having, by cross-examination of witnesses for the defense, attempted to show unusual interest of these witnesses in the defendants\\' behalf, it was competent for defendant on rebuttal to ask witness if he was in any way related to either of the defendants. $$ The fact that, after Briley had been shot down, there was a negro standing near the scene with a pistol resembling in some particulars a pistol owned by deceased, is not relevant. There was no evidence tending to connect Briley with this pistol. $$ There was no evidence tending to connect the fatal difficulty with anything transpiring in the commissary of deceased some hours before the shooting, and hence all testimony as to what occurred between the parties in the commissary was illegal and irrelevant. $$ The condition of Briley as to whether he was under the influence of liquor at the time of the difficulty was relevant, and should have been admitted. $$ The fact that Briley had a pistol just prior to the fatal difficulty was relevant and properly admitted in evidence, but the details of a transaction between Briley and some negroes just prior to the difficulty here involved was not relevant. $$ Whether either of the defendants said or did anything to provoke the difficulty with Briley was a question of fact for the jury. The witnesses could testify to all of the facts relating to the res gest of the transaction, but not to conclusions. The court did not err in refusing to permit the defendants to testify that they did not say or do anything to bring on the difficulty. $$ Proof of the general bad character of Briley for peace and quiet was properly admitted in evidence, but the court properly refused to permit defendant to prove particular acts of violence. $$ General character is based upon reputation, and not upon the personal knowledge of a witness who undertakes to testify as to general character. Hence the court properly excluded the testimony of George Pope as to the good character of defendants, after he had testified that he based his testimony as to character exclusively on his own personal knowledge of defendants. Stone v. State, 208 Ala. 50, 93 So. 706. $$ The rule with reference to the admission of testimony taken on another trial was the subject of adjudication in the case of Leo Bush v. State, 19 Ala. App. 650, 100 So. 307. The rule is stated in the dissenting opinion in the Bush Case, supra, which rule is approved in the majority opinion, but the facts in the Bush Case were found by the majority to differentiate that case from the general rule. The state having offered a part of the testimony of the witness Dock Jones, the defendant was entitled to the whole. Bush Case, supra. $$ Charles Simmons was shown to have been on his front porch while the difficulty was taking place. Mr. Bricken, one of defendants\\' attorneys, in his address to the jury stated this fact, and then added, \"The state has not examined him as a witness, and the defendants have not examined him as a witness\". Upon objection by the state, this remark was excluded. This was not error. This was an adroit, if indirect, way of commenting upon the failure of the state to examine this witness, which may not be done. $$ There are 28 written charges refused to defendant. Some of these charges state correct propositions of law; where this is *Page 250  $$ the case, they are amply covered by the oral charge of the court, which in minute detail covered every phase of the case. There are no new or unusual questions presented by any of these refused charges, and we see no good reason for specifically passing upon each of them. The court did not err to the prejudice of defendants in refusing the written charges as requested. $$ For the errors pointed out, however, the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded. $$ Reversed and remanded.']\n"
